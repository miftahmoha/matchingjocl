During this project, we received data from TotalEnergies that contains signals representing the quantity of gas found in different depths. Each signal represents a hole dug in a specific place. We'll use sparse methods of resolving over-determined systems to learn a dictionary from the training database. Finally, we'll use such dictionary to reconstruct the incomplete signals.
